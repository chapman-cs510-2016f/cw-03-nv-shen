## Specification

Complete the following exercises, saving your solutions in the indicated files. For Python files that include test functions, GitHub will automatically run your tests with ```nosetests``` on every commit, indicating any failures via the Travis framework in the build status image above.

1. Create a python file ```sequences.py``` with a function ```fibonacci(n)``` that returns the first ```n``` Fibonacci numbers in a list. (Recall that each successive Fibonacci number is defined by summing the previous two, starting with the numbers 1 and 1.) Commit to GitHub.
    * Hint: Use the python template file in the info repository to make sure you have the correct structure. You should have a #! line at the top, a module docstring, function definitions, function docstrings, and informative comments in your code.
    * Example: ```fibonacci(5)``` should return ```[1,1,2,3,5]``` 
    * Example: the last element of ```fibonacci(1000)``` should be: 43466557686937456435688527675040625802564660517371780402481729089536555417949051890403879840079255169295922593080322634775209689623239873322471161642996440906533187938298969649928516003704476137795166849228875L (Note: what does the L at the end of this integer mean in Python? Explain in your module docstring.)
    * Write 3 test functions that verify whether this function outputs the correct results.  
    * Make sure the function only returns a list. Have it throw an exception if a nonsensical argument ```n``` is given (i.e., not a positive integer).
1. Write an executable python script ```fib.py``` that loads ```sequences.py``` as a module, reads one command line argument ```n```, runs ```fibonacci(n)```, then prints the last element of the result. Commit the script to GitHub.
    * If an exception is thrown, catch it and print an appropriate error message to the screen. 
    * Make sure you use the template to set up a proper ```main(argv)``` method called from inside a ```___main___``` environment. Your script should not execute any code if it is loaded as a module.
    * Remember to make your script executable with ```chmod```. 
    * Write a test function to verify that the main function operates as intended. 
1. Write a bash script ```runfibs.sh``` that uses bash to run ```fib.py``` for arguments ```n``` from 1 to 10000.  For each argument, redirect the output of the script to a comma-separated-value file ```fibs.csv``` such that each fibonacci number is separated by a comma (with no newlines). Commit the shell script (but not the csv file) to GitHub.
    * If a ```fibs.csv``` file already exists, back it up: move the existing file to ```fibs.csv.bak```, then create the new file. Inform the user that this backup occurred.
    * If a backup already exists, inform the user, then exit the program with an error code (not 0) before any files are overwritten.
